                <h4 class="text-success">Difference between var let and const :</h4>
                <p>var declarations are globally scoped or function scoped while
                    let and const are block scoped. var variables can be updated and re-declared within its
                    scope; let variables can be updated but not re-declared; const variables can neither be
                    updated nor re-declared.
                    They are all hoisted to the top of their scope. But while var variables are initialized with
                    undefined, let and const variables are not initialized.
                    While var and let can be declared without being initialized, const must be initialized
                    during declaration.</p>

                <h4 class="text-primary">Difference between arrow and regular function :</h4>
                <p>In regular function, this value is dynamic, In arrow function it equals to
                    this of the outer function.

                    In regular function, arguments will give you list of parameter passed in function, In arrow
                    function arguments is not defined.

                    In regular function, you always have to return any value, but in Arrow function you can skip
                    return keyword and write in single line.

                    In arrow function parameters should be unique.

                    Hoisting matters in arrow function as function get not be invoked before initialisations.</p>

                <h4 class="text-info">What is map, forEach, filter and find in JS?</h4>
                <p>map: Function .map() is a manipulative function that can modify each elements content in an array
                    that
                    it is called on. This function returns a new array with modified values <br> <br>
                    forEach: Function .forEach() is another form of just a plain for loop that can be used to iterate
                    through array items. This case of a function is used for more complex arrays, for example, an array
                    of
                    objects with a lot of entries than just an array of integers. <br> <br>
                    filter: Function .filter() is a search function that returns all the elements that fulfil the
                    assigned
                    condition. You can search by simple terms, for example, that element is equal to a certain integer,
                    or
                    by more advanced terms, for example, searching for an object with certain property that is equal to
                    something. Both examples have a very frequent use as a developer. <br> <br>
                    find: Function .find() is also a search function like the previous but they differ in one small
                    detail â€”
                    this function returns only one match in an array. If in an array is more than one result, the
                    function
                    will return the first that has matched.</p>

                <h4 class="text-danger">What are the advantages of using template string?</h4>
                <p>there are two very specific advantages to using template literals: Multi-line strings: A single
                    string
                    can span two or more lines. Expression Interpolation: Javascript variables and expressions can be
                    inserted directly in the string.</p>
